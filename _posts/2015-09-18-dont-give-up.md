## Sometimes life will kick in the crotch

But that's okay. It's a part of life. Life is not defined by the days we relaxed on the beach enjoying the summer sun. Rather life is defined during the times we were kicked in the crotch and we still limped on while others gasped. When life knows kicking you in the balls will do it no good, you will find happiness in any situation.

Do you agree with me? Watch this awesome (and funny) video of the topic.
